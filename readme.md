#Responsive and Assets

1- Implemented **Responsive Grid System** and **Flexbox** was used for modules.

Flexbox Notes: Flexbox was added only to the `.modal_album` module. As for IE, even if flexbox does not work, page will display original order of items.



2- **Media Queries** 3 breakpoints were made with mobile-first media queries. 

- The mobile default shows items in a single column at full width 
- The middle breakpoint shows items in 2 columns
- The large layout has a mix of 3 and 2 column sections

3- **Responsive Images** 

- Replaced the "Find" buttons with icons using Ico-moon. 
- Set the backround image to an SVG. This doesn't have real benefit in this context but we got experience toying around with SVG data code and DUI data.
- All images are set to a percantage based width for responsiveness in space

4- **Modernizr** Modernizr was added to use a fallback png for the background svg. This is for IE8.





#####   *Added a separate stylesheet for all media queries*
